# My SoftUni RactJs Project

About The Application
-----------------------
  This is a Web Application that can be used to store and play Guitar Pro Tablature Files. 
A Long Time i wish to create such an application for the Web and I finally succeeded and I am very happy to present it as my project
for SoftUni ReactJs Exam.

    Guitar Pro is a software program available on Windows and Mac OS that allows all musicians to read, write and share their tablatures.
You can find many tablature files on internet, but on very few places you can played its for free.


For Test The Project I have submitted several tablature files in this repository in 'docs/Test_Tablatures' or you can download for example from here https://guitarprotabs.org/
